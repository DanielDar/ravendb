#Delete

Every file modification has to be reflected on the destination server. The same is for a delete file operation. When the file is deleted the system creates a marker that allows us to detect that
the destination server has the file that was already deleted on the source. The delete synchronization is actually sending a POST message to destination server `/synchronization/delete` endpoint.
