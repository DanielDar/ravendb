## Indexing

RavenFS allows you to look for files by using [Lucene query syntax](http://lucene.apache.org/core/old_versioned_docs/versions/3_0_0/queryparsersyntax.html). You can search a file by using:

* name
* size
* directory
* date of modification
* any metadata.

The more files and corresponded metadata you add the more search terms you can use to build your search query. All available search fields you will find under `search/terms` endpoint. Here is an explanation of built-in search fields: 
(let's assume that we have a file *documents/pictures/wallpaper.jpg*)

* __key - the full name of the file (*"documents/pictures/wallpaper.jpg"*),
* __fileName - the last part of file path (*"wallpaper.jpg"*),
* __rfileName - the reversed version of the _fileName, it allows searches that ends with wildcards (*"gpj.repapllaw"*),
* __directory - the list of directories associated with the file (*"/documents/pictures"*, *"/documents"*, *"/"*),
* __level - the nesting level (3),
* __modified - the date of indexing (the date index format is *yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss*),
* __size - the file length (in bytes) stored as string,
* __size_numeric - the file length (in bytes) stored as numeric fields, what allows to search by range.

A sample query to find all files under */documents* directory (or nested) that name ends with *.jpg* and size is greater than 1MB:

`__directory:/documents AND __rfileName:gpj.*  AND __size_numeric:[1048576 TO *]`

The search supports sorting as well (ascending and descending), the possible options of sorting are:

* by name,
* by size,
* by date of modification.

The easiest way to search for files from the code is to use either [Client API](../client-api/index) or [HTTP API](../http-api/index).

Searching is also supported by The Studio, where you will find useful predefined search filters:
